# Deep-Q-Learning-Car

This project utilized Deep Q Reinforcement Learning to teach an agent (car) to go around a track, picking up checkpoints along the way.

The car controls its forward or backwards velocity with the W and S keys, and changes its direction with A and D
It used a Markov Decision Process to train a neural network on which inputs to use given how far away it was from a check point and walls around it.
